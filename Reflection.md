# Reflection

## Organization / Planning:

* Fairly evenly distributed workload

* Created a discord channel with good organization

* Created and shared a team google drive for plan and reflection

* Collected and compiled everyoneâ€™s emails, and timetables in one place

* Sorted different information into separate discord text channels for better accessibility
* Separated workload logically and grouped specific sections together for less overlap of workload 
* Started too late 
* Underestimated workload and collectively pulled an all nighter
* Facebook was not an option
* Need more optimal meeting times
* Jason had a hectic schedule to accommodate for

### Summary
Overall organization was mediocre, which was not surprising considering that this was the first week that we operated as a team. We used discord and google drive alongside gitlab as communication platforms where we could store important information. Team meetings were used to allocate workloads and clarify specifications. However, our team started group work very late and an underestimation of the work-load due to a collective misinterpretation of the requirements forced us to work overtime. 

## Communication:

* Had fairly frequent team meetings at university ( 2 to be precise )

* Had online voice call meetings when not available for offline ones

* Meetings are of decent length ( 1 - 2 hours at a time )

* Frequent team communication during the programming process

* Need to check in more frequently on discord

### Summary
Communication was excellent (In comparison to many other teams we have experienced). This was in part due to the fact that our team size is small (3) and it was very easy to all be available simultaneously. Our frequent presence on discord allow team members to post alerts (eg. we had a space where assumptions could be dumped as we wrote the tests). Voice calls were used so that we could easily ask each other for help, or opinions and this made sure the tests were acceptable quality. 

## Technical:

* Tests were written to a good standard as peer reviewed by the group.

* Version control was clunky
* Specification was not pulled from master.
* Specification was read incorrectly and it took a while to figure out how to write the tests

### Summary
 Only very minor hiccups occurred. There was not many difficulties in terms of technical. Since we had excellent communication we easily solved a problem when a group member had an issue. We figured out our general direction of testing after one meeting and only had to scrap a small amount of work. All coding completed on time.
