## How often you met, and why you met that often

Initially, our team planned to meet up, one to two times a week. This is because we didn’t want to fall behind in our workload especially when our team has only 3 members. We also decided that starting earlier and having more frequent meetings would give us better results, since for iteration 1 we had poor usage of the task boards and gitlab in general due to time constraints and consequently poor organisation.
 
## What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful

Meetings were planned before-hand using a list of discussion topics in a Q/A style format for appropriate choices. Conclusions were noted down within the meeting. We also organized for the first meeting in this iteration to decide on the structure and discussion points of the meetings to follow. We decided on:
* Spec questions
* Progress update
* Peer review 
* Revise timeframe/deligation
* Other circumstance specifics
Topics would be addressed in that order. Unfortunately, many meetings were missed and by the next meeting not enough had been completed to be able to discuss any further.



## What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration two

When things did not go to plan, or when we were running behind on schedule we talked to each other in any way available. This included meetings, private messages and online voice call meetings. Some meetings were focused on getting everyone on the same page while others were for pair coding to get work done more efficiently. 
In the planning focused meetings, our team discussed over assignment specifications and conveyed our thoughts in how we would implement and structure our server to meet those specs. We would then split up the tasks for the near future, and pin them onto the to do list in the tasks boards so we would have an easier time managing the workload and keep track of what needs to be completed. This helps us progress in our project, so we could move on to the next stage of development in our plan for iteration 2. 
In our pair programming meetings, which were much more prevalent in the later weeks of this iteration,  as a team we fixed up many of our harder problems that we encountered individually.
Many of these pair programming sessions occurred over discord, where we would voice call and screen share in order to pair program and help each other out. This meant that we were progressing through our functions at a much better rate since we were getting immediate help from other members when any of us encountered a problem. 
Overall, good communication and teamwork through having meetings and voice call frequently, helped us overcome unseen problems when things did not go to plan, and sped up our work efficiencies when we were running behind on schedule.

## Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code 

We split the overall responsibility for different structures within the project into thirds, but this did not mean that we did not modify each other’s code due to the complex dependencies. Often members would be waiting on the code of another members for a bug fix, and it would be much more efficient to modify each other’s code, posting about the change. We also made an effort to be all working on the code simultaneously.

## Agile Practices:

We used discord in conjunction with the task board on gitlab to track each other’s progress. We were able to communicate very efficiently through combinations of posting code, screenshots, or even screen-sharing so we can receive real time inputs and modify code on the spot. Even when there are times we could not meetup, voice calls proved more than sufficient substitute that. With these tools we were able to give each other feedback quickly and efficiently while also communicating what we have done and problems that we were facing.
