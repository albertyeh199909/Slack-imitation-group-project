# Reflection on teamwork


Reflect on your use of agile practices and how you worked as a team.

Your reflection should, at a minimum, include:

### How often you met, and why you met that often

Initially, our team planned to meet up, one to two times a week. This is because we didn't want to fall behind in our workload especially when our team has only 3 members. We also decided that starting earlier and having more frequent meetings would give us better results, since for iteration 1 we had poor usage of the task boards and gitlab in general due to time constraints and consequently poor organisation.
 
### What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful



### What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration two

When things did not go to plan, or when we were running behind on schedule we talked to each other in any way available. This included meetings, private messages and online voice call meetings. Some meetings were focused on getting everyone on the same page while others were for pair coding to get work done more efficiently. 

In the planning focused meetings, our team discussed over assignment specifications and conveyed our thoughts in how we would implement and structure our server to meet those specs. We would then split up the tasks for the near future, and pin them onto the to do list in the tasks boards so we would have an easier time managing the workload and keep track of what needs to be completed. This helps us progress in our project, so we could move on to the next stage of development in our plan for iteration 2. 

In our pair programming meetings, which were much more prevalent in the later weeks of this iteration,  as a team we fixed up many of our harder problems that we encountered individually.

Many of these pair programming sessions occurred over discord, where we would voice call and screen share in order to pair program and help each other out. This meant that we were progressing through our functions at a much better rate since we were getting immediate help from other members when any of us encountered a problem. 
Overall, good communication and teamwork through having meetings and voice call frequently, helped us overcome unseen problems when things did not go to plan, and sped up our work efficiencies when we were running behind on schedule.

### Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code 

As mentioned above, we had in real life meetings and online voice call plus screen sharing through discord in order to get multiple people working on the same code. This in combination with gitlabs basic functions, got the job done.
