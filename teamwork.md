### Teamwork

Reflect on your use of agile practices and how you worked as a team.

Your reflection should, at a minimum, include:


###### How often you met, and why you met that often

For iteration 3 our group has decided to meet up more frequently then before in
order to get more on top of our workload. However we also agreed on not
enforcing face to face meetings as we felt the accessibilty that we had through
discord was a more viable choice. On average our team would have 1 meeting face
to face and 1 to 2 meetings online, just to discuss the things that we needed to
do in the near future.

###### What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful

In order to insure productive meetings, our team made plans for what we were
going to discuss in the meeting beforehand. This kept us on track for meetings
and we were always able to ensure everyone was on the same page and knew what
their part was. The plans also speed up our meetings to a shorter time frame of
1hr or so, so we could get proper discussions done in our tight schedules.
At the end of each meeting we would start thinking about what we needed to do in
the future so we could write our plan for the next meeting. Overall, this process
really helped us in being efficient with our time when it came to meetings.

###### What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration 3

Our team has a team discord, which we use for standups on a daily basis. When
things don't go to plan we would generally see this on the standups channel and
the next step would be to add a comment in the meeting plans on what needs to be worked on for the
next meeting. This would then be discussed and resolved, usually within half a week as we have half weekly meetings.
In situations where one person has too much workload or has questions with a 
particular area of the code, we would share screens on discord and perform some
pair programming or give advice through voice channels if we aren't with each other
in person.

###### Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code 

As discussed above, we would make use of discord's screen share function while 
we did pair programming. This allows for the whole group to see exactly what the
other person is doing from the comfort of our homes. As a result, I feel like our
team has used pair programming/ group programming more than the average group in
this project.
